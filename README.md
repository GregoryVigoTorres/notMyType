# Not My Type #

Browse, preview and download fonts.


The goal of this project was to build a simple app with a straight-forward interface for searching and downloading fonts. Downloaded fonts include a CSS @font-face snippet and the font license.


A live version can be found at (https://notmytype.herokuapp.com)


The font database was built from my fork of (https://github.com/google/fonts).
Due to some limitations of Heroku, this is a lightly curated selection of the fonts available from Google.
All the fonts have free licenses, but be sure to check the license for the font you want to use.


This project was built with *Flask*, *SQLALchemy*, *PostgreSQL* (migrated from MariaDB) and Angular 1.5.
