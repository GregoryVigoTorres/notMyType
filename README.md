# Not My Type #

Browse and download free fonts.


The goal of this project was to build a straight-forward interface for searching and downloading fonts, without too many features that most people probably don't need.


A live version can be found at (notmytype.heroku.com)


The font database was built from (https://github.com/google/fonts)

All the fonts have free licenses.


This project was built with *Flask*, *SQLALchemy*, *PostgreSQL* (migrated from MariaDB) and Angular 1.5
