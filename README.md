# Not My Type #

Browse, preview and download fonts.


The goal of this project was to build a simple app with a straight-forward interface for searching and downloading fonts.


A live version can be found at (notmytype.heroku.com)


The font database was built from my fork of (https://github.com/google/fonts)
All the fonts have free licenses, but be sure to check the license for the font you want to use.


This project was built with *Flask*, *SQLALchemy*, *PostgreSQL* (migrated from MariaDB) and Angular 1.5
